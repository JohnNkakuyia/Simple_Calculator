# Simple Calculator Program

## Description
This is a basic command-line calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

## Features
- Supports four basic operations: +, -, *, /
- Handles division by zero errors
- Validates user input for operations
- Displays the calculation in a readable format

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended)
2. Enter the first number when prompted
3. Enter the second number when prompted
4. Choose an operation by entering one of: +, -, *, /
5. The program will display the result or an error message if the input is invalid

## Example Usage
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): *
10.0*5.0 = 50.0
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Limitations
- Only works with two numbers at a time
- Only supports basic arithmetic operations
- No memory or history functions

## Error Handling
The program handles:
- Division by zero (prints "Error: undefined (division by zero)")
- Invalid operation input (prints "Error: Invalid operation. Please enter one of +, -, *, /.")
